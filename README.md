# To-Do App - Hexagonal Architecture
>This is a simple task management application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. It provides endpoints to manage tasks via an HTTP API.

## :speaker: How it works

### Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is http://localhost:3000/home/

### Endpoints
Retrieve All Tasks
```
    Description: Retrieves a list of all tasks currently stored in the system.
    HTTP Method: GET
    Endpoint: /tasks
    Request Parameters: None
    Response: An array of task objects, each containing details such as ID, title, description, status, etc.
```

Retrieve a Specific Task
```
    Description: Retrieves details about a specific task identified by its unique ID.
    HTTP Method: GET
    Endpoint: /tasks/:id
    Request Parameters:
        id (integer): ID of the task to retrieve.
    Response: A task object containing details about the requested task.
```

Create a New Task
```
    Description: Adds a new task to the system.
    HTTP Method: POST
    Endpoint: /tasks
    Request Body: JSON object representing the new task, including details such as title, description, status, etc.
    Response: Success message indicating the task has been created.
```

Update an Existing Task
```
    Description: Updates an existing task with new information.
    HTTP Method: PUT
    Endpoint: /tasks/:id
    Request Parameters:
        id (integer): ID of the task to update.
    Request Body: JSON object representing the updated task details.
    Response: Success message indicating the task has been updated.
```
Delete a Task
```
    Description: Deletes a task from the system.
    HTTP Method: DELETE
    Endpoint: /tasks/:id
    Request Parameters:
        id (integer): ID of the task to delete.
    Response: Success message indicating the task has been deleted.
```

## ðŸ•¹ Features

- ```Architecture Hexagonal``` <br/>Organizes the application around a central core, isolating domain logic from external concerns.<br/>

- ```Middlewares``` <br/>Functions that intercept and process requests and responses, providing reusable, cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, or error handling.<br/>

- ```API Rest``` <br/>Implements a representational state transfer (REST) architecture, providing a standardized way of building web services that are scalable and interoperable.<br/>

- ```TDD``` <br/>Development process where tests are written before the code, guiding the implementation and ensuring code quality and correctness.<br/>

- ```CD/CI``` <br/>Streamlines the development workflow by automating the integration, testing, and deployment processes for faster and more reliable software delivery.<br/>

## :building_construction: Hexagonal Architecture

The Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters is a design pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of the core business logic from external dependencies.

### Benefits

- **Modularity:** The architecture promotes modularity by clearly defining boundaries between different parts of the system, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Testability:** Separating the core domain from external dependencies simplifies testing, as it allows for easier mocking and isolation of components during testing.

- **Flexibility:** The Hexagonal Architecture allows for changes to external systems or technologies without impacting the core domain logic, providing flexibility and future-proofing.

### Structure


```
src/

â”œâ”€â”€ application
|    â”œâ”€â”€services              // Application services
|    â””â”€â”€ dtos                 // Data Transfer Objects
|
â”œâ”€â”€ domain
|    â”œâ”€â”€ entities             // Business entities
|    â””â”€â”€ interfaces           // Domain interfaces

â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure
     â”œâ”€â”€ database             // Persistence layer implementations
|    â”œâ”€â”€ repositories         // Handle the persistence of domains
|    â””â”€â”€ services             // Infrastructure services
|
â””â”€â”€ interfaces
     â”œâ”€â”€ controllers          // HTTP request handlers
     â”œâ”€â”€ routes               // API route definitions
     â””â”€â”€ middlewares          // Middleware functions

```

```application:```  
- Application services coordinate high-level operations involving multiple domain entities.
- DTOs are used to transfer data between processes or components, without any business logic.

```domain:``` 
- Entities are the main business objects of the application. Value objects are immutable objects distinguished only by the state of their properties.
- Domain interfaces define the operations that can be performed on entities and value objects.

```infrastructure:``` 
- Repositories handle the persistence of entities.
- Infrastructure services can be anything that provides technical capabilities, such as sending emails, data persistence, etc.

```interfaces:``` 
  - Controllers handle HTTP requests and delegate work to application services.
  - Routes define the HTTP routes of your application.
  - Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware in the application's request/response cycle.


## :floppy_disk: Technologies
- Node.js

## :space_invader: Scripts

### Testing:

```sh
npm run test
```

Run tests ignoring those existing in dist/

### Prettier format:

```sh
npm run prettier-format
```

Manually run Prettier in the project, I recommend installing the Prettier extension and having it auto-run on save.

### Watcher:

```sh
npm run dev:watcher
```

Run nodemon using src/index.ts as the entry file.

### Dev Run:

```sh
npm run dev:run
```

Run the project without a watcher.

### Build:

```sh
npm run build
```

Compile the project into dist/

## Debugger

The debugger configuration points to src/index.ts as the project's entry file.
The debugger configuration is located in the .vscode/launch.json file.
